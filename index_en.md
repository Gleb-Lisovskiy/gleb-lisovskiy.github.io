## About me

**Please note that there may be problems with the translation.**

Hello, my name is Gleb and I am 17 years old.

I am an ordinary programmer of the Mappet (JavaScript) mod ~~3~~ half a year in Minecraft.  
I am currently working on the project **The Madness Of Drones**.

What else can I do:
* I can, but not as a pro, model in BlockBench.
* I am good at animating, for example, models of Minecraft players.
* I'm already good at drawing, but I only drew skin. As for the texture of the objects, I haven't tried it yet.

I also really don't like quarrels and conflicts.  
I prefer to work alone, but you can offer to help me.

**I refuse to help with the creation of the model, texture and construction.**

### Other information. 

I like to animate more than create models.  
I love black and white styles.

Atmosphere designer.  
Mod collector version 1.20.1, to make it clearer, I know how to make builds for minecraft on version 1.20.1, knowing 200+ mods and which of them may conflict with each other.  
And I don't always know how to put commas.  

A fan of the classic Call of Duty Zombies.  
A fan of Calamity mod.  
A fan of the series Murder Drones, the character of V and Lizzie.

~~A little obsessed with projects~~
