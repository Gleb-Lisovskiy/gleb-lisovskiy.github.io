## About me

<img class="profile-picture" src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/89039577?s=400&u=34a4ae82646edfcd5de2c457af79e3fcc2d7a903&v=4">

**Please note that there may be problems with the translation.**

I wish you good health, gentlemen, my name is Gleb and I am 17 years old.

I've been a regular programmer of the Mappet (JavaScript) mod for more than half a year in Minecraft.  
I'm working on the project **The Madness Of Drones** and at the moment I'm making a realistic TacMove animation system.
TacMove has been under development for at least 3 months.

What else can I do:
* I can, but not as a pro, model in BlockBench.
* I am good at animating, for example, models of Minecraft players.
* The drawing is 50/50. 

I also really don't like quarrels and conflicts.  
I prefer to work alone, but you can offer to help me.

**I refuse to help you create with models, textures, and constructions.**

### Other information. 

I like to animate more than create models.  
I love black and white style.

Atmosphere designer.  
And I don't always know how to put commas.
