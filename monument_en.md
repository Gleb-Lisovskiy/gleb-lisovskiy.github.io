**Ryzhiy (Red-haired) 2019-2025**
=

This is my cat who has lived with me for 6 years, which is the same age as him.  

This cat's name is Red (That's what my mom called it) and we had a very good life with him.  

Before that, I had other cats, these are Basia, Kosya and Rhea (Also called Shmonka).  

The redhead was found in the yard and brought home.  
I became friends with Kosya, Basya, and Sher Khan (That's my dog's name).  

The Redhead's character changed after Kosya died,
And because of this he became more affectionate, and before he was more of a bully.

Every time I go to feed the cats, the Redhead just screams, wants delicious jelly food.

**Died at 1:10 p.m. on March 29. 2025 and being close to it.**  
**Cause: Anemia**

**Rest in peace, Ryzhiy.**
