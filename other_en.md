# About the project **The Madness of Drones**

This is a (semi-) large-scale fan project mode in Minecraft, which is being developed with great difficulty.  
But at the moment, another project is being developed, which is easier to do it.

This mode presents itself as hardcore survival with a plot set in the altruistic universe of [Murder Drones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mImFz8mkaHo&list=PLHovnlOusNLiJz3sm0d5i2Evwa2LDLdrg )  
The mode is somewhat similar to the [Decaying Winter] play (https://www.roblox.com/games/13438553315/Decaying-Winter ) from Roblox, but it's much tougher than you might think.  

If you don't understand, it's like surviving in hell.  
In this mode, you need to be careful, attentive and act stealthily. Pray that they don't notice you.  
It is necessary to observe almost every step and also constantly listen to every sound.
